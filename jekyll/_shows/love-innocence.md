## About

His first show at the Pleasance, marking the beginning of what would become a legendary career.

## Notes

This show established many themes that would recur in later works, particularly the blend of self-deprecation and profound storytelling that would become Kitson's signature.

The show ran for the full Edinburgh Fringe run and received critical acclaim.
