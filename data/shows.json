Voices soaring from between trees to paint tears on the face of the moon; words, like fire in the night, laughter exploding through the dark. The day not done, not yet, the air thick with magic on the cusp of tomorrow.\n\nDaniel Kitson and Gavin Osborn return to Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre for this ridiculously exciting notion. Born three years ago in giddy post show euphoria, resurrected last year in a similar state of wonder and pushed through a wintery gloop of logistical troubles to this rather wonderful folly.\nThe Idea: To conceive, write and perform three separate stories for three separate summer shows, all starting at midnight and lasting a little over an hour. A twinkling thought is about to become a magical reality. All conceivable obstacles to success have been moved, avoided or obliterated save for one trifling concern. Will anybody actually come to a park at midnight to listen to a story?",

Ages. So long. Years. Oh god. Nothing stays the same does it? Dust on the wind. That’s all we are.\n \nAnyway – here we are. The D Machine (Me) and G Unit (Gavin), back on tour. Doing it right.\n \nIn 2009 (Seriously, isn’t the passage of time horrifying?) we wrote a trilogy of story (Me) and song (Gavin) ultra combo mega shows called “Stories for the Starlit Sky” and comprising three interlinked stories about love (obviously), staying up all night (naturally) and a village populated by retired assasins (yeah, that makes sense).\n \nWe performed them in Regents Park Open Air Theatre on three separate summer nights, one in June, one in July, one in August and all of them at midnight. There were indeed stars in the sky. Some people brought flasks.\n \nA couple of years later, we whacked them out over consecutive nights at the Latitude festival from the middle of a lake in a slightly futile battle against the ambient bass of various DJ sets and whooping, intoxicated infants.\n \nWe also did them once to raise money for Forest Fringe and so I could impress a woman who went home after the first story.\n \nMost recently in July of this year (2015, obviously guys) Regents Park Open Air Theatre had a spare night after a late drop out - I rewrote the stories a bit (one of them really quite a lot) Gavin practiced his songs and we performed all three of the shows in one night. One after the other.\n \nIt was great.\n \nSo, that’s what this (indoor) tour will be, the whole blinking trilogy on one night complete with two intervals.\n \nBoom. Break. Boom. Break. Wallop.

I’ve worried and doubted and waited more and more and more.

Somewhere between East London and South London - It arrived. The Idea. Just like that. Like a child, late home from school, oblivious to the worry and the panic and the phone calls. It just walked in and sat down like it wasn’t even a big deal.\n\nSo now I’m typing this in my bedroom because the boy who lives next door is playing the James Bond theme on what I assume to be a trumpet.\n\nAnd you have to trust me.\n\nTwo hours ago I didn’t have the idea.

I did work in progress shows of it two years ago (a few nights at the Trades Club in Hebden Bridge and a few weeks at The Roundabout in Edinburgh) and over the course of those, it developed into a really really good story about two people with a satisfying mystery at the middle of it and I really liked it. I had plans to turn it into some vaguely experimental play, but then the kerfuffle happened and that plan fell away. Then, in June of this year, i did two weeks of work in progress on the show as an Audio Only Online Storytelling Experiment™ during which time, I tweaked it and changed it, I realised it was a story about telling stories and I was frankly, delighted by how well it worked as an audio thing. So now I’m going to work on finishing it over the rest of August and most of September, then I’ll record it three times, once for the LPs, once for the CDs, and once for the Casette Tapes. The finished version will never be performed live and there are no plans to make it available as a download which means this show will only exist on/in these objects.\"",

I didn’t march and I didn’t go swimming and I didn’t get tested and I did not “read more”. I’ve not been on a boat. I’ve not been shielding, I’ve not been struggling with childcare, I’ve not been playing football on Tuesdays, I’ve not been killed and I’ve not been attending gatherings of up to six households.

We’d made some frightening lanterns from turnips and learned a pretty frightening song about witches.\n\nBut when my Dad walked in he wasn’t frightened. \n\nHe was, if anything, visibly relieved.  \n\nNow, this was a long time ago so I don’t remember all the details but apparently, my Dad, having pulled round the corner to see the house in total darkness was confused and a little concerned as to the whereabouts and, by extension, the wellbeing of his family. So, walking in to find two small boys brandishing candle lit vegetables and singing a song about how they were the ugliest witches he’d ever seen was in an odd way, quite reassuring.\n\nLater, he said he’d been worried by all the lights being off and I felt bad about causing that worry.\n\nI still do.*\n\nA singularly seasonal story by Daniel Kitson that is definitely funny, potentially frightening and maybe, just maybe, a ghost story.",

We’d made frightening lanterns from turnips and we’d learned a frightening song about witches.\n\nBut when my Dad walked in he wasn’t frightened.\n\nHe was, if anything, visibly relieved.\n\nApparently, having found the house in complete darkness he’d immediately been concerned as to the whereabouts and wellbeing of his family. Which meant that opening the door to find his sons waggling candle lit turnips and singing about being witches was, actually, quite close to comforting.\n\nHe said later, that he’d been worried by all the lights being off and I felt bad about that.\n\nI still do.*\n\nA new show by Daniel Kitson written specifically for these two nights in this one place that will be funny, might be frightening and may, in spite of everything, be a ghost story.",
