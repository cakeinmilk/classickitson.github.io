Voices soaring from between trees to paint tears on the face of the moon; words, like fire in the night, laughter exploding through the dark. The day not done, not yet, the air thick with magic on the cusp of tomorrow.<br />Daniel Kitson and Gavin Osborn return to Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre for this ridiculously exciting notion. Born three years ago in giddy post show euphoria, resurrected last year in a similar state of wonder and pushed through a wintery gloop of logistical troubles to this rather wonderful folly.<br />The Idea: To conceive, write and perform three separate stories for three separate summer shows, all starting at midnight and lasting a little over an hour. A twinkling thought is about to become a magical reality. All conceivable obstacles to success have been moved, avoided or obliterated save for one trifling concern. Will anybody actually come to a park at midnight to listen to a story?",

That’s all we are.<br />Anyway – here we are. The D Machine (Me) and G Unit (Gavin), back on tour. Doing it right.<br />In 2009 (Seriously, isn’t the passage of time horrifying?) we wrote a trilogy of story (Me) and song (Gavin) ultra combo mega shows called “Stories for the Starlit Sky” and comprising three interlinked stories about love (obviously), staying up all night (naturally) and a village populated by retired assasins (yeah, that makes sense).<br />We performed them in Regents Park Open Air Theatre on three separate summer nights, one in June, one in July, one in August and all of them at midnight. There were indeed stars in the sky. Some people brought flasks.<br />A couple of years later, we whacked them out over consecutive nights at the Latitude festival from the middle of a lake in a slightly futile battle against the ambient bass of various DJ sets and whooping, intoxicated infants.<br />We also did them once to raise money for Forest Fringe and so I could impress a woman who went home after the first story.<br />Most recently in July of this year (2015, obviously guys) Regents Park Open Air Theatre had a spare night after a late drop out - I rewrote the stories a bit (one of them really quite a lot) Gavin practiced his songs and we performed all three of the shows in one night. One after the other.<br />It was great.<br />So, that’s what this (indoor) tour will be, the whole blinking trilogy on one night complete with two intervals.<br />Boom. Break. Boom. Break. Wallop. Hometime.",

Three magical stories about love, quiet heroism and a small village of retired assassins are woven together with 14 wonderful songs of sadness, laughter and beauty that pay eye-dampening tribute to the glory of staying up all night. Originally performed as three separate shows on three separate nights, the duo will perform the entire trilogy in one delightfully funny and achingly melancholic wallop of laughter and tears.",

      After a song by Gavin Osborn, Daniel Kitson introduced the evening, outlining its structure: the show would unfold in segments, performed in various spots around the room.
      Audience members were handed torches to spotlight the action as it happened. The night featured a blend of elements, including songs by Gavin, a list of things that make Daniel happy, 
      Gavin reading cassette sleeve notes penned by John Oliver for a compilation tape he once gifted him, and Kitson engaging with a pre-recorded Isy Suttie. 
      Among Gavin’s songs, three have been released commercially, while the rest remain unreleased.
      <br /><br />
      The pre-recorded segments, styled as phone calls, showcased Daniel Kitson performing live alongside Isy Suttie’s pre-recorded responses. 
      These interactions followed Keith (Kitson) as he initially reached out for companionship through a classified ad, speaking with Linda (Suttie), an employee at the local newspaper. 
      In later recordings, Keith revised his ad and lodged a noise complaint with Linda, who had since taken a job at the local police station. 
      The final segment brought the story full circle, with Keith placing another classified ad—this time directed at Linda herself, who was once again working at the newspaper.

    Lit by lamplight, a dungaree-clad Daniel Kitson introduced the evening; Gavin Osborn would perform five songs, he would read out a list of 25 items. 
    And these would be interspersed with four recordings featuring Tim Key and Isy Suttie.
    <br /><br />
    Kitson's list is prefaced with an announcement that he’s lost faith in the pursuit of love, 
    describing himself instead as someone who destroys people whilst checking within them for magic. His list comprises 25 worthwhile things he could be doing.
    <br /><br />
    Two of Gavin's songs would later appear on his April 2022 album <em>Scrolling Home</em>.<br /><br />
    The recordings capture Duncan Thwaite (Key), who has set up a complex IVR system in his home, linked to 47 phones, with the help of a confused engineer he dubs Keith. 
    Two later recordings capture someone silently navigating Duncan's intricate menu. In the final recording the caller is revealed to be Lucy, a customer service rep (Suttie). 
    Questioning the need for such a system and whether the contract should be renewed, she finally reaches Duncan.
    <br /><br />
    Running order:<br />
    Daniel - Introduction<br />
    Recording #1<br />
    Gavin - <em>I Guess I Drifted</em> - early version<br />
    Daniel - Worthwhile things 1-5<br />
    Gavin - <em>John's Not Got a TV</em> - unreleased<br />
    Recording #2<br />
    Daniel - Worthwhile things 6-11<br />
    Gavin - <em>A Couple of Days</em> - unreleased<br />
    Daniel - Worthwhile things 12-15<br />
    Recording #3<br />
    Gavin - <em>Dear Gavin</em> - unreleased<br />
    Daniel - Worthwhile things 16-20<br />
    Recording #4<br />
    Gavin - <em>Just a Little Space</em><br />
    Daniel - Worthwhile things 21-25
    <br /><br />
    Keith would later be used as the name of the person holding script #1 in <em>Collaborator</em>.

We’d made frightening lanterns from turnips and we’d learned a frightening song about witches. But when my Dad walked in he wasn’t frightened.f anything, visibly relieved. Apparently, having found the house in complete darkness he’d immediately been concerned as to the whereabouts and wellbeing of his family. Which meant that opening the door to find his sons waggling candle lit turnips and singing about being witches was, actually, quite close to comforting. I still do.

    notes: `
    In a January 2024 newsletter, Kitson mentioned discussions with the Royal Exchange in Manchester about his hopes to stage something there within the next 18 months. 
    By summer '24, it was confirmed on BBC London Radio that he was starting to write, planning a premiere by October. 
    The show's development was in motion by September when he announced in another newsletter that a new show would indeed debut later that autumn.
    <br /><br />
    The Royal Exchange confirmed details on their website on September 11, releasing a show name, dates, a poster, and a blurb for the upcoming run. 
    These disappeared a few days later.<br /><br />
    Two work-in-progress performances under the title <em>Standing Start</em> were scheduled at the Bill Murray in London for late September and 
    a few days later <em>PITH</em> returned to the Royal Exchange website. 
    Reviews of the Manchester staging were positive, gaining 3.5/5 stars from Chortle and 4/5 from The Times, both finding it engaging but acknowledging the 
    show's deliberately unfinished quality (Kitson admitting within the show that it became quite clear to him that the show would likely be in a finished state by 
    Spring 2025).<br /><br />
    On November 3, the Bill Murray announced a 'Super Secret Daniel Kitson Gig'—a staging of <em>PITH</em>—for the following day. 
    This was ostensibly an opportunity for Daniel to record the show, incorporating the additions he'd made during the Manchester run.<br /><br />
    The show has numerous links to elements from previous shows:<ul>
    <li>Cassette tapes – used in <em>C-90</em>, <em>Stories For the Wobbly-Hearted</em>, <em>Analog.Ue</em>, and <em>Polyphony</em>.</li>
    <li>his recurring daydream of running a coffee shop that doesn't have to operate as a business sounds a lot like his dream from <em>66A Church Road</em>, 
    to run an unprofitable record shop/cinema</li><li>His other recurring daydream, &quot;to have another human being know him entirely&quot; evokes one of 
    his aims from <em>Outside. Again</em> &quot;to be known better by someone than I know myself&quot;</li>
    <li>&quot;Stories are good&quot; directly contradicts a line from <em>Collaborator</em>, where Kitson's character professes that &quot;Stories are lies. They’re either made up and pretending to be true or they’re true but acting like someone made it up.&quot;</li>
    <li>Meredith Winston/Winnie, Robert Pickles/Mr. Pickles/Bob/Pickle – nearly 
    all his stories have at least one character where it's significant to the plot and/or their character development what name they get called 
    (<em>C-90</em>, <em>Stories For the Starlit Sky</em>, <em>Gregory Church</em>, <em>Always Right Now Until It's Later</em>, <em>This Story Has No Title</em>, 
    <em>Tree</em>, <em>Analog.Ue</em>, <em>Mouse</em>, <em>A Short Series of Disagreements</em>), and in the narration of <em>Shenaniganagain</em>, 
    he explains that he likes to pick character names that can be shortened to nicknames so he can use this in the story.</li>
    <li>Winnie – in <em>PITH</em>, the name of the character who promised in 2004 that she'd meet a guy on a bench in 2024, and in 
    <em>It's Always Right Now Until It's Later</em>, the name of the girlfriend the main character had in his 20s, then after the breakup couldn't find love 
    with anyone else and told his dates that he'd be single forever because he'd missed his &quot;first big swing&quot; at love – both analogous to 
    real-life stories Kitson told in the early 00s.</li>
    <li>Bob trying to &quot;erase his life&quot; by recording over his tapes is reminiscent of an idea in <em>Keep</em>, where Kitson considered 
    burning down everything he owned so he could start fresh.</li>
    <li>The story about repeating the word &quot;cunt&quot; with his friend as teenagers – repeating it to desensitize each other to the word – was 
    in his untitled 2005 Edinburgh show.</li>
    <li>His &quot;last mile of a marathon&quot; analogy is quite similar to the orchard/family analogy from <em>Everything Smells of Orange</em> in 2019. 
    (And that orchard/family analogy came from <em>It's Always Right Now Until It's Later</em> from 2010, and was referenced even earlier as something Kitson's 
    parents did.)</li>
    <li>Bob leaving his tapes in random places for random people to find is very similar to Poppy's story in <em>Stories For the Wobbly Hearted</em>.</li>
    <li>Two main characters meet by chance on public transport and an older man recounts a story to the younger person is a motif from 
    <em>The Ballad of Roger and Grace</em>.</li>
    <li>Kitson mentions the inspiration for one of the characters on the bus is a real life man whose irritating t-shirt slogan read 
    &quot;You Need to Calm Down&quot;. This is likely a shirt inspired by the Taylor Swift song of the same name.</li>
